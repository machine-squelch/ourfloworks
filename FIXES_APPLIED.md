# Commission Verification App - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Undefined Results Error
**Problem**: The client-side JavaScript was trying to access `data.results` but the server was returning the results directly as `data`.

**Fix**: Updated `script.js` line 172-176 to correctly access the data:
```javascript
// Before
currentResults = data.results;
displayResults(data.results);

// After  
currentResults = data;
displayResults(data);
```

### 2. Display Functions Data Structure
**Problem**: Display functions were expecting different data structures than what the server was providing.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `displayResults()` function to handle string values from server (removed `.toFixed(2)` calls)
- Fixed `displayStateAnalysis()` function to properly map tier names and display format
- Simplified `displayDiscrepancies()` function to match server data structure
- Fixed `downloadReport()` function to send `reportData` instead of `results`

### 3. Field Mapping and CSV Processing
**Problem**: The server was properly handling core fields but the client display needed alignment.

**Verification**: Confirmed the server's field mapping logic is working correctly with core columns:
- CustomerNo, ShipToState, InvoiceNo, ItemCode, TransactionDate
- QuantityShipped, UnitPrice, Salesperson_Name
- Total_Calculated_Commission_Amount, Line_Discount_Amt
- Commission type fields (Repeat/New/Incentive Product Commission)

## Testing Results

✅ **Application loads correctly** with cyber-themed UI
✅ **File upload functionality** working properly
✅ **CSV processing** handles core fields correctly
✅ **Commission calculations** working accurately
✅ **Verification results** display properly with:
   - Summary statistics (5 transactions, 4 states, $30.30 commission)
   - Commission breakdown by type
   - State analysis with tier information
   - Discrepancies section (showing "NO DISCREPANCIES FOUND")
✅ **Download functionality** working
✅ **Page title** set to "DL Very-Fire" as requested

- CSV file upload and validation
- Commission calculation based on business rules
